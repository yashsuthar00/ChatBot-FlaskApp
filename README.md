# ChatBot-FlaskApp

A mini chatbot project built using the Flask framework. This project demonstrates how to create a simple conversational bot that interacts with users and responds to their queries. It's a great starting point for understanding the basics of web development with Flask and integrating basic chatbot functionality.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Text-based interaction with the chatbot
- Easy to deploy and run locally

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python.
- **HTML/CSS**: For creating the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For handling frontend interactions.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ChatBot-FlaskApp.git
   cd ChatBot-FlaskApp
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Flask application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the application**:
   Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to interact with the chatbot.

## Usage

After running the Flask application, you can start chatting with the bot by typing messages into the input field and hitting "Send". The bot will respond to your queries based on the logic implemented in the Flask application.
